# React Todo List

In this exercise I want you to create a todo list with React Typescript. The todo list is will be simple, not any fancy functionalities or animations _(unless you relly want to get creative)_. The purpose is to solve as much as possible with React and apply a react mindeset. I have created a React TS application to you that is ready to be used.

**Before you start, you must run a `npm install` in this folder in order to install all the dependencies. Then you do a `npm run dev` in order to start the application. NO "Live Server" usage here as Vite will fire up a development server for you.**

Below you have a couple of User Stories that are going to follow.

- As a user I want to be able to view all my todos in the same place, to get a good overview of what I have to do.

- As user I want to be able to add new todos to my todo list so I can update my todo list when I find something else that I need to do.

- As a user I want to mark a todo as completed so I can see which todos I have left to do.

- As a user I want to remove a todo from the list so I can keep my list as clean and short as possible.

- As a user I want to be able to move todos up and down in order to prioritize what I have to do.

- As a user I want everything on my todo list on the same page because I don't want to navigate between pages and to get a good overview of everything.

- As a user I want to be able to put my name _(author of a todo)_ on a todo, so everyone in my family can add their own todos to the todo list.

- As a user I want to be able to edit existing todos in case I remember something that has to do with a specific todo.

- As a user I want a timestamp to be added to my new todos in order better se how old all the todos are.

- As a user I want to be able to sort my todos after either timestamp or author.
