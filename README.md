# React Todo List

[Live Demo Here](https://sockulags.github.io/Lexicon_TS_TodoList)

An exercise in React, making a todo-list. I have made this for desktops so therefore it isnt respoonsive as of right now.

### Functionality
- Create, edit and delete tasks, with a custom delete confirm pop-up. 
- Have the option to set a task a occuring. For example, If you'd do weekly grocery shopping on Sundays, that task would on be showing on Sundays. If it's not occuring, the task will show daily until completed and deleted.
- Today's date will load upon visit. 
- Simple navigation between home, task and other dates. 

### To-be-done
Since I have more assignments todoðŸ¤“ I'll leave at this for the moment. The assigment was to make a todo-app with create, sort, complete and delete functionality with the parameters I have included in the app. Everything else is extra.
- Upon Edit, occuring option "Yes" is pre-selected.
- Tasks completed will following allowing until you delete. For occuring tasks I haven't solved the issue for how to make the tasks set to not-comleted when it re-occuring on a later day.
- Add an option to "Select all" for the filtering.
- Make the page responsive. 

### How to use
- Download or copy the repo.
- Open the todo_lister directory with, for example, VS Code and run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run the command `npm run dev` and have fun.
